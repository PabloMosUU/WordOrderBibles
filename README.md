# WordOrderBibles

This repository contains multiple attempts to study entropy using the bible, including training LSTMs, computing perplexities with GPT-2, and performing word-pasting and word-splitting experiments. A much more limited of this repository, including only the word-pasting experiments, is in the BibleWordPasting repository.
