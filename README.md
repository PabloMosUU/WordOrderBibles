# WordOrderBibles

This repository contains multiple attempts to study entropy using the bible, including training LSTMs, computing perplexities with GPT-2, and performing word-pasting and word-splitting experiments. A much more limited of this repository, including only the word-pasting experiments, is in the BibleWordPasting repository.

2025 Update: this paper has been published in Coling-Rel and, therefore, there is no need to maintain it anonymous anymore. However, the link provided in the camera-ready paper is anonymous. The published paper can be found [here](https://aclanthology.org/2025.clrel-1.9/).

The GitHub repository including all branches is [here](https://github.com/PabloMosUU/WordOrderBibles).
